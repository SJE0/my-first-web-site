  <p>An encyclopedic classic of Korean medicine titled “Donguibogam (Principles and Practice of Eastern Medicine)”
  refers to spring as “release of the old.” It also recommends taking care of one’s health according to the natural cycle of
  seasonal changes as the human body is part of nature’s creation. That’s why eating seasonal food is important.
  With new buds and sprouts at th
  eir peak, it is time to eat green leafy veggies. Having endured the unforgiving cold of a harsh winter,
  spring veggies represent the tenacious life force and boost our physical and mental energy.</p>
